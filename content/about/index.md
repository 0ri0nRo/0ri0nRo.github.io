Hey, welcome to my website ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alexandru Andrei Colacel, a graduate in Computer Science from Sapienza UniversitÃ  di Roma, currently employed at Lutech since 2023.

Since I was young, I've had a passion for computer science, spending hours in front of the screen in my grandparents' room. This interest led me to attend a technical high school, where I delved into the basics of computer science and got in touch with programming languages like:
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- C
- Python
- Java

During my academic journey, I studied a wide range of subjects, from mathematical foundations to automata theory, from software engineering to computer architecture. I always sought to integrate theory with practice, acquiring concrete skills in software development and algorithm implementation.

In addition, my thesis focused on developing a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), exploring its applications in IoT and utilizing technologies such as Solidity, Go, and Docker.

Currently, I'm pursuing a master's degree in Cybersecurity, where I am deeply involved in exploring topics such as risk assessment, threat modeling, and vulnerability management. My coursework includes:

- Cryptography
- Network Infrastructures and Security
- Distributed Systems and Scalability
- Applied Statistics for Cybersecurity
- Cyber and Computer Law
- Ethical Hacking and Security Testing
- Cyber-Physical Systems and Security
- Internet of Things (IoT) Security
- Malware Analysis
- Security Governance and Compliance
- Blockchain and Distributed Systems
- Machine Learning for Security
- Data and Network Security Strategies

I am also focused on cloud security, particularly in the engineering and protection of applications, infrastructures, and cloud environments like AWS.

I am enthusiastic about using my knowledge and skills to contribute to your organization's success and projects.
